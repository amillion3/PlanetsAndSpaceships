            //Use Add() again to add Pluto to the end of the list.
            //Now that all the planets are in the list, slice the list using GetRange() in order to extract the rocky planets into a new list called rockyPlanets.
            //Being good amateur astronomers, we know that Pluto is now a dwarf planet, so use the Remove() method to eliminate it from the end of planetList.

            //Create another dictionary that will hold the name of a spacecraft that we have launched, and a list of names of the planets that it has visited.Remember that List is a Type just like native types(such as string, int, &bool) and your custom types(such as Movie, Dog, and Food). They can be passed to anything, like a dictionary, as a Type.
            //Iterate over your list of planets from above, and inside that loop, iterate over the dictionary. Write to the console, for each planet, which satellites have visited which planet.
